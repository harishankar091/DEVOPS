What is the Containerization?
ans) Containerization is the process of packaging an application and all its dependencies
(libraries, configs, runtime) into a single lightweight, portable unit called a container.

--> Containers ensure the application runs the same way anywhere --- on a developer's laptop, test
    environment, or production servers.

--> In Devops, containerization bridges the gap between Development and Operations, making deployments 
    faster and more reliable. 

--> The most popular containerization platform is "Docker".

Why is Containerization important in Devops?
ans) Devops aims to unify development and operations through automation, collaboration 
and continuous delivery. Containerization supports this by:

1: Environment Consistency
--> ."works on my machine" problems disappear.
    . Containers run the same way on a developer's laptop, a server or in production.

2: Speed and Effiency
--> . Containers are lightweight and start up in seconds
    . Ideal for CI/CD pipelines and microservices.

3: Isolation
--> . Each container runs independently, making it easy to isolate application or services.

4: portability
--> . Containers can run on any system that supports the container runtime(linux, windows, cloud platforms.....etc).

5: Scalability
--> . Easy to scale up or down using orchestrators like kubernetes or docker Swarm.
