                                MONITORING:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is the MONITORING?
ans)monitoring is the continous collection and analysis of data from applications, servers, databases,
and infrastructure to understand system health, performance, and availability.

Types of monitoring
1.infrastructure Monitoring: CPU, memory, disk, network usage.
2.Application Performance Monitoring(APM): Response times, error rates, API performance.
3.Log Monitoring: Collection logs in real time to detect errors and unusual behavior.
4.User Experience Monitoring:Synthetic monitoring, real-user monitoring(RUM).
5.Sercurity Monitoring:Intrusion detection,anomaly detection.

Key Benefits:
. Detect issues before customers notice.
. Improve system reliability and uptime.
. Provide data for scaling decisions.
. Enable proactive incident response.

Key Aspects of Monitoring:
--> System Monitoring: Observing server performance, CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, network latency.....etc.
--> Application Monitoring: Monitoring application performance, response times, error rates, and throughput.
--> Infrastructure Monitoring: Monitoring cloud or on-prem infrastructure, such as virtual machines, containers, and network configurations.
--> Real-Time Alerts: Automated  notifications when something abnormal happens. These alerts can be 
based on thresholds or abnormal patterns.
--> Metrics Collection: Gathering numerical data such as error rates, response times, request counts, etc.
which helps in understanding the system's health and performance trends over time.

Popular Monitoring Tools:
1.Promrtheus + Grafana
2.Datadog
3.New Relic
4.Zabbix
5.Nagios
6.AppDynamics
7.Splunk Observability



                                    LOGGING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is Logging?
ans) Logging involves capturing detailed information about system behavior, errors, events, and transactions in real-time. logs provide a trail of what happening inside the system, and they are invaluable when troubleshooting issues.

Key Aspects of Logging:
--> Centralized Logging: All logs from different services and environments are collected and stored in a
central location for easy analysis and quering.
--> Structured logging: Logs should be structured in a consistent format (JSON, key-value pairs) to make 
it easier to process and analyze them.
Log levels: Different levels of logging (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR) help filter logs based on their 
importance.
--> Log Rotation and Retention: Implementing log rotation to manage disk space and setting retention.
--> Log Analytics: Using tools to analyze logs for patterns, trends, and anomalies. 
--> Corelation with Monitoring: Logs should be corelated with monitoring data to provide context during 
incident investigations.

Key Benefits of logging:
. Troubleshooting failures quickly.
. Track security incidents.
.understand user behavior.
. Audit system changes.
. Compliance with regulatory requirements.

popular logging tools:
1.ELK Stack(Elasticsearch, logstash, Kibana)
2.Graylog
3.Fluentd/Fluentbit
4.Splunk
5.Datadog
6.Promtail + Loki + Grafana
